# Python-Experiments

This repository contains the experimetns with which I have played around while learning Python.

The examples are either
* ipynb files, than can be opened with a [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) or through [Google Co-laboratory](https://github.com/googlecolab), for example.
* py files, traditional python script files in [Pyhon 3.x](https://github.com/python)
